# BetaZero

<h2>Welcome to the BetaZero project repo.</h2>

<h3>Our motivation and Aim:</h3>

We are building a full-functioning chess engine written in C and C++ that would be implemented
in a server-api, using Python, Cython, Django and database storage using Firebase. 
We want to make a completely open source chess engine with a simplistic backend, that is really easy to understand and re-implement. And yes, the name takes after AlphaZero
  
<h2>Development Stages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
      <strong>Phase 1 :</strong> <ul>
      <li>Development of the C/C++ Engine : In this phase we'll be focusing all our efforts in the development, assimilation, refactor and optimization of the core C++ Engine, and to develop the code according to well defined modularised design patterns. This stage is implementation heavy and is the backbone of our project</li>
    <li>Research and foundation for integrating a C engine in a Django/Firebase workspace.</li>
   
<li><strong>Completion Characteristic :</strong> Fully developed Chess Engine in C with minimal errors. 
  Basic simplistic chess UI in Bootstrap.  </li>
</li></li>
</li></ul>
<br>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong><ul>
    <li> Development and Completion of the  Basic and Advanced functionalities of the website including Basic login features, storage, username, and veiw of the gameplay
    using websites. This would be implemented with Django, Firebase, and Bootstrap.</li>
  <li> Completion of the UI/UX Components of the Website. (With Animations and veiw of past games)</li>
  <li> Handling of Issues in the code, and optimality updates.</li>
   
   <li><strong>Completion Characteristic :</strong>Fully developed website with integration of Chess Engine in the Django backend,with professional rating and leaderboard, forums.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li><strong> Further Phases:</strong><ul><li>The further phases would be decided later. Especially developing an Android App connected to BetaZero API and levelling the engine to at least 2000 in LiChess rating are in sights.</li></ul>

<h2> FAQ's regarding the project </h2>

<ol>
  <li>How do I test the code?<ul>
    <li><strong>Windows</strong> : Download BetaZeroCode and make that as a repository, run make inside the repository and run the executable BetaZero </li>
    <li><strong>Linux</strong>   : To test the code, download BetaZeroCode and make that as a repository, run make inside the repository and run./BetaZero in the terminal.</li>
